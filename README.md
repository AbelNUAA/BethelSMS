 The system also includes a student user interface, which will allow students to obtain information and make queries online, cutting down on processing time.
 All information is kept preserved on SQL servers that are administered by the academy administrator, guaranteeing the highest level of protection possible.
 The program contains a sophisticated logging system for tracking all users' access and ensures that data access guidelines are followed. 
 It is expected to enhance the accuracy of the school's record management by minimizing the number of work hours required to access and generate records of the students to users.
